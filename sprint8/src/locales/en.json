  "section1-text-paragraph": "Trees provide multiple benefits to the urban environment and the quality of life in cities. Amongst others, trees can help to adapt to the changing climate, by reducing air temperatures through shading and evapotranspiration, managing stormwater and reducing wind speeds. They can also act as a carbon sink, thus contributing to climate change mitigation efforts. Further, trees benefit mental and physical health, e.g. by lowering stress levels, reducing the amount of toxic particles in the ambient air or providing a pleasant environment for cycling and walking. Lastly, trees - especially old, native ones - provide habitats for wildlife and increase biodiversity in urban areas.",
